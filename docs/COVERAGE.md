# Test Coverage (Planned)

## How to Check Coverage
- Run unit test coverage:
  ```sh
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```
- Run E2E (Cypress) coverage (requires plugin):
  ```sh
  # See https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage
  npx cypress run
  ```

## Best Practices
- Aim for at least 80% coverage on all business logic and hooks
- Add coverage checks to CI

> This is a placeholder. Enable coverage tools as your test suite grows.
