# Storybook UI Documentation (Planned)

Storybook is a tool for developing and documenting UI components in isolation.

## How to Add Storybook
1. Install Storybook:
   ```sh
   npx storybook@latest init
   ```
2. Run Storybook locally:
   ```sh
   npm run storybook
   ```
3. Add stories for your components in `src/components/*.stories.tsx`

## Best Practices
- Document all reusable UI components
- Use stories for different states/variants
- Use Storybook for visual regression testing

> This is a placeholder. Add stories and run Storybook as your component library grows.
